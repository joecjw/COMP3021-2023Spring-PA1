     *
     * Please note that the string after @ is exactly the key of the paper.
     * For example:
     * @article{Bourdoncle1993,
     *    abstract = {Abstract interpretation ...},
     *    author = {Fran√ßois Bourdoncle},
     *    isbn = {9783540573166},
     *    issn = {16113349},
     *    journal = {Lecture Notes in Computer Science ...},
     *    pages = {128-141},
     *    title = {Efficient chaotic iteration strategies with widenings},
     *    volume = {735 LNCS},
     *    year = {1993},
     * }
     * The key of the paper should be Bourdoncle1993.
     *
     * Hint: The function might be quite verbose if you just define this method to achieve the functionality.
     *       You can try to define several helper methods to process different kinds of lines in the bib file,
     *       and then invoke them in this method.
